# ROVER URDF THINGS
Since theres like, a trillion urdfs in this file, I wanted to write a readme about all the differences between each.

<b>ALSO I KNOW XACRO EXISTS AND I COULD HAVE MADE THESE ALL MACROS BUT I DIDN'T KNOW IF MATLAB AND LOAD IN XACRO FILES AND I'M LAZY</b>.
If we ever needed these URDF's for anything else (and not just one URDF) it would be in our best interest to convert the crane
and rover to separate xacro files for easier management, and such. Romeo OUT!

## CRANE/ Folder
This folder has URDF of the crane by itself!

### crane_old2.urdf
This is the second iteration of the crane design. there is no crane_old1.urdf cause I just
kept it unseparate in the rover_crane_old1.urdf, so if you want the first design of the crane you 
can find it there

## ROVER_CRANE/ Folder
This folder contains the URDF for the crane + rover

### rover_crane_old1.urdf
This is the first design of the rover/crane concept

### rover_crane_old2.urdf 
This is the second version of the rover/crane concept
