Controller Assembly Guide:
	Electronics for most systems are fairly straight forward. PWM extension leads are soldered onto the arm servos and routed in such a way as not to snag. These are plugged into available PWM channels of the reciever and the system is programmed accordingly.
	For the handgrip, change the board_pins.h definition file in %appdata%/Roaming/arduino15/packages... for the ESP32S3 Dev board to look for SDA on Pin 1 and SCL on Pin 2. Pins 3, 4 and 5 and go to the buttons and the other side of the buttons goes to ground.
	5V on all systems comes from the output of the boost converter and ground is again common.
	Using an external antenna is not necessarily needed but you'll have to desolder the board-mounted connector and use as short a length of wire as possible or use grounded 50 ohm coax.
